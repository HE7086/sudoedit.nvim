# sudoedit.nvim
Let nvim detect filetype properly when used with **sudoedit**

* If you only use `sudo nvim somefile` for editing, this plugin is not needed, as filename is correctly provided to neovim.
* This plugin detects the parent process' cmdline.
* When nvim is spawned by `sudoedit`, `sudo -e` or `sudo --edit`, it will trigger filetype detection based on the original filename, instead of the temporary file generated by sudoedit.
* Enjoy editing system configuration files with proper syntax highlighting :)
* Only supports Linux (as of now (do other OSs really use sudo anyways?)) and BSD (untested)
* MacOS' sudo does not support `sudoedit`

## usage
* Lazy.nvim
```lua
  { "HE7086/sudoedit.nvim" }
```

## configuration
* It seems that some versions of sudoedit spawns nvim as a child instead of a "grandchild" as on my machine. If this is the case for you, enable `parent = true`
```lua
  {
    "HE7086/sudoedit.nvim",
    opts = {
      parent = true,
    }
  }
```

## notes
* This plugin does not work if the fileypte cannot be detected normally. E.g. on NixOS, where most of the files under `/etc` are symlinks, and `sudoedit` does not allow editing symlinks.
